## WHAT IS HELLO PROGRAM WORLD?
we will learn to create a simple program named "Hello World" in C programming.

A "Hello, World!" is a simple program that outputs Hello, World! on the screen. Since it's a very simple program, it's often used to introduce a new programming language to a newbie.

## Let's see how C "Hello, World!" program works.

The #include is a preprocessor command that tells the compiler to include the contents of stdio.h (standard input and output) file in the program.
The stdio.h file contains functions such as scanf() and printf() to take input and display output respectively.
If you use the printf() function without writing #include <stdio.h>, the program will not compile.
The execution of a C program starts from the main() function.
printf() is a library function to send formatted output to the screen. In this program, printf() displays Hello, World! text on the screen.
The return 0; statement is the "Exit status" of the program. In simple terms, the program ends with this statement.

## ADDING TWO INTEGER
In this example, the user is asked to enter two integers. Then, the sum of these two integers is calculated and displayed on the screen.To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following C programming topics:

### C Data Types
### C Variables, Constants and Literals
### C Input Output (I/O)
### C Programming Operators
In this program, the user is asked to enter two integers. These two integers are stored in variables number1 and number2 respectively.
Then, these two numbers are added using the + operator, and the result is stored in the sum variable.
Finally, the printf() function is used to display the sum of numbers.


## how IF STATEMENT work?
he if statement evaluates the test expression inside the parenthesis ().

If the test expression is evaluated to true, statements inside the body of if are executed.
If the test expression is evaluated to false, statements inside the body of if are not executed.

##  how to MULTIPLY TWO NUMBER?
n this program, the user is asked to enter two numbers which are stored in variables a and b respectively.
Then, the product of a and b is evaluated and the result is stored in product.
Finally, product is displayed on the screen using printf().
Notice that, the result is rounded off to the second decimal place using %.2lf conversion character.


## what is SWITCH CASE?
The switch statement allows us to execute one code block among many alternatives.


## SYNTAX OF IF ELSE
The if statement evaluates the test expression inside the parenthesis ().

If the test expression is evaluated to true, statements inside the body of if are executed.
If the test expression is evaluated to false, statements inside the body of if are not executed.
